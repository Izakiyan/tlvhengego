Manhattanhenge — sometimes referred to as the Manhattan Solstice — is an event during which the setting sun is aligned with the east–west streets of the main street grid of Manhattan, New York City. This occurs twice a year, on dates evenly spaced around the summer solstice.

The first shot of the event is recorded back to the year 2001 in New York City, since then Manhttanhenge has gain recognition among photographers and romantic couples who want to capture a unique sunset effect in the background.

Other cities such as Toronto, Montreal and Chicago have chosen to follow and adapt Henge days of their own. 

Around six months ago professor Yoav Yair, dean of the Sustainability School at IDC Hertzlya presented the Manhattanhenge effect in one of his classes and challenged the students to find the talked about effect in Tel Aviv City.
Yaniv Izaki, who was a sustainability and economics student at the time decided to take the gloves off and accept his professor's challenge. Together with Oriel Bachar, his partner in the project and former student at IDC they developed a program that merges between the varying sun’s rays angles during the year and Tel Aviv streets alignment to predict the dates for the next henge events in the corresponding streets. 

You can find all the events listed in a site devoted to the project at www.tlvhenge.com
